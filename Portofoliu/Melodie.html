<p style="text-align:center"><br>
  It was great at the very start<br>
Hands on each other<br>
Couldn't stand to be far apart<br>
Closer the better<br>
<br>
Now we're picking fights and slamming doors<br>
Magnifying all our flaws<br>
And I wonder why, wonder what for<br>
Why we keep coming back for more<br>
<br>
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?<br>
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight<br>
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?<br>
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?<br>
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight<br>
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?<br>
<br>
Too much time, losing track of us<br>
Where was the real?<br>
Undefined, spiraling out of touch<br>
Forgot how it feels<br>
<br>
All the messed up fights and slamming doors<br>
Magnifying all our flaws<br>
And I wonder why, wonder what for<br>
It's like we keep coming back for more<br>
<br>
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?<br>
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight<br>
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?<br>
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?<br>
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight<br>
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?<br>
<br>
Scared to be lonely<br>
<br>
Even when we know it's wrong<br>
Been somebody better for us all along<br>
Tell me, how can we keep holding on?<br>
Holding on tonight 'cause we're scared to be lonely<br>
Even when we know it's wrong<br>
Been somebody better for us all along<br>
Tell me, how can we keep holding on?<br>
Holding on tonight 'cause we're scared to be lonely<br>
<br>
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?<br>
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight<br>
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?<br>
<br>
Scared to be lonely<br>
Scared to be lonely<br>
Eh, eh, scared to be lonely<br> </p>
